# Features

This folder is organized by implementation status.

- `docs/features/implemented/` — documentation for features that are shipped/active in production.
- `docs/features/concepts/` — PR-ready concepts, working-backwards docs, and RFC-style writeups for features not yet implemented.

If a concept becomes implemented, move its doc into `implemented/` and update any cross-links.
